Modern parallel and cluster file systems provide highly scalable I/O bandwidth
by enabling highly parallel access to file data.
Unfortunately metadata access does not benefit from parallel data transfer,
so metadata performance scaling is less common.
To support metadata-intensive workloads,
we offer a middleware design that layers on top of existing cluster
file systems, adds support for load balanced and
high-performance metadata operations without sacrificing data bandwidth.
The core idea is to integrate a distributed indexing mechanism
with a metadata optimized on-disk Log-Structured Merge tree layout.
The integration requires several optimizations including cross-server split
operations with minimum data migration, and decoupling of
data and metadata paths. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach,
we implemented a prototype middleware layer \sys
and evaluated it with a 5 metadata server, 50 data server Panasas
parallel file system. Our \sys middleware improves
metadata performance of this PanFS parallel file system by
as much an order of magnitude,
while still performing comparably on data-intensive workloads.
