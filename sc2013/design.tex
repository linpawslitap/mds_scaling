Figure \ref{fig:design} presents the overall architecture of our scalable
metadata service. Our metadata service is a middleware inserted into
existing deployments of cluster file systems to improve metadata efficiency
while maintaining high I/O bandwidth for data transfers.
The system uses a client-server architecture,
and consists of three core components:

\begin{itemize}
\item{\textbf{Client:}} Applications interact with our middleware
through the FUSE user-level file system \cite{fuse},
through a library directly linked into the application
or through a module in a common library such as MPI-IO \cite{mpi}.
The stateless client-side code redirects applications' file operations
to the appropriate destination according to the types of operations.
All metadata requests (e.g. \texttt{create()} and \texttt{mkdir()}),
and data requests on small files (e.g. \texttt{read()} and \texttt{write()}),
are handled by the metadata indexing modules that address
these requests to the appropriate server.
For all data operations on large size files, the client code redirects
the request directly to the underlying cluster file system to take full
advantage of data I/O bandwidth. A newly created, but growing file
may be transparently reopened by the client module.

\item{\textbf{Metadata Indexing Server:}}
Each indexing server manages its local metadata storage backend to store and
access all metadata information and small file data.
It uses the GIGA+ algorithm to
partition large directories across indexing servers. It also monitors the growth
of small files, and migrates newly large files into
the underlying cluster file system
when its size exceeds a threshold.

\item{\textbf{Metadata Storage Backend:}}
The metadata storage backend is a modified version of \tfs which packs metadata
and small file data into large, log-structured, flat files,
and stores these files
in the underlying cluster file system. Since \tfs converts random updates into
sequential writes, it greatly improves disk performance. In order to
dynamically redistribute large directories,
the metadata storage backend also modifies
\tfs to support exporting and importing flat files in batch.

\end{itemize}

Remainder of this section describes more details of our system.
Section \ref{design.giga} presents a primer on how \giga distributes metadata.
Section \ref{design.tablefs} shows how \tfs stores all file system metadata
and small files using a single on-disk structure on each server.
Section \ref{design.integration} focus on the challenges in effectively
integrating \giga and \tfs to work with existing cluster file systems.

\subsection{Integrating \giga{} and \tfs{}}
\label{design.integration}

To effectively build a middleware that integrates
the \giga distribution mechanism and \tfs,
we have to tackle two main challenges:
one is to modify \tfs to support for
migrating directory partition required by \giga;
the other is to decouple metadata and data paths to
achieve high performance for both paths.
This section discusses the modifications we made to
overcome the two challenges.


~\\
\textbf{Metadata representation -- }
\tfs stores all metadata including \giga hash
partitions for directories, entries in each hash partition, and other
bootstrapping information such as root entry and \giga configuration state.
The general schema used to store all file is:

\begin{table}[!htc]
\begin{tabular}{c|c}
key & \texttt{parentDirID,gigaPartitionID,hash(dirEntry)} \\
\midrule \\
value & \texttt{attr(dirEntry),[symlink|data|gigaMetaState]} \\
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:keyschema}
\end{table}

The main difference from the \tfs schema described in Section
\ref{design.tablefs} is the addition of two \giga specific fields:
\texttt{gigaPartitionID} to identify a
\giga hash partition and \texttt{gigaMetaState} to store the
hash partition related mapping information for directories.
These \giga related fields are used only
if large directories are distributed over multiple metadata servers.
A optimization is to eliminate \texttt{gigaPartitionID} in the key
by using the same hash function for both \giga and \tfs keys,
since the hash of entry name can determine the partition ID.

~\\
\textbf{Partition splitting -- }
The local \tfs instance stores \giga hash partitions and their directory
entries as SSTable Files in the underlying cluster file system.
Recall that each \giga server process splits a hash partition $P$ on
overflow and creates another hash partition $P'$ which is managed by a
different server; this split involves migrating approximately half the entries
from old partition $P$ to the new hash partition $P'$ on another server.
During splitting, the partition in migration has to be locked from
concurrent accessing for correctness.
We explored several ways to perform this cross-server partition split.

A straightforward solution would be to perform a range scan on
partition $P$, and remove about half the entries
(that will be migrated to the new partition $P'$) from $P$.
All removed entries are batched together
and sent in an RPC message to the server that will manage partition $P'$.
The split receiver inserts each key in the batch into its own \tfs instance.
While simplicity of this solution makes it attractive,
it is slow in practice and vulnerable to failures during splitting.
We have to devise a faster and safer technique to
reduce the time that the splitting range is locked.

The immutability of SSTables in \ldb makes such a fast bulk insert possible --
an SSTable can be added to Level 0 without its data being pushed through the
write-ahead log and minor compaction process.
To take advantage of this opportunity, we extended \tfs
to support a three-phase split operation:

\begin{itemize}
\item{Phase 1:} The split initiator performs a range scan on its \tfs instance
to find all entries in the hash-range that needs to be moved to another server.
Instead of packed into an RPC message,
the results of this scan are written in SSTable format to files in the
underlying cluster file system.

\item{Phase 2:} The split initiator notifies the split receiver about
the paths to the SSTable-format files in a much smaller RPC message.
Since these files are stored in shared storage,
the split receiver directly inserts these files as symbolic links
into the \ldb tree structure without actually copying these files.

\item{Phase 3:} The final step is a clean-up and commit phase:
after the receiver completes the bulk insert operation, it notifies the
initiator, who then deletes the migrated hash-range from its \tfs instance
and unlocks the range.
\end{itemize}

The three phases of splitting can be refined even further:
Assume that the splitting is initiated at the time $T_{split}$.
The split initiator can generate SSTables containing entries
older than $T_{split}$ without locking the hash range.
When the generation of SSTables with entries older than $T_{split}$ is finished,
the split initiator can lock the hash range and then write SSTables with
newly added or updated entries later than $T_{split}$.
By doing so, the duration of locking splitting hash range can be further reduced.
However, due to the code complexity of this optimization,
we left this optimization for future work.

~\\
\textbf{Decoupled data and metadata path -- }
All metadata and small file operations go through the \giga server;
however, following the same path for data operations on large files
would incur an unnecessary performance penalty of shipping data
over the network an extra time.
This penalty can be significant in HPC use-cases
where large files can easily be gigabytes to terabytes in size.

To avoid this penalty our middleware is designed to perform all
data-path operations of large files directly
through the cluster file system module in client machine.
Figure \ref{fig:design} illustrates this data path (in BLUE color).
Once the application tries to open a file with size greater than $T$,
our client library code will get back a symbolic link to the physical
path in the cluster file system, and open it locally.
All subsequent accesses to this large file will force
the client operating system to read/write through the native cluster file system client.
Thus applications can achieve the same data bandwidth.
FUSE-based clients can use the same trick but with additional overhead
of double context switching and memory copying \cite{PLFS}.
Recent work \cite{fuseopt} shows that FUSE kernel module can be modified
to make performance degradation less than $3\%$. We have not implemented
this modification in our current prototype.

While the file is open, some of its attributes (e.g., file size and last access time)
may change relative to \tfs's per-open copy of the attributes.
\giga servers monitor what large files are currently opened for access.
For attribute quires to these open files, \giga will directly query the underlying
cluster file system to get the most updated attributes.
Later \giga will synchronize these changes on file close on the metadata path.
Other attribute changes relative to permissions can be updated in-flight
through \giga servers.
By doing so, \giga servers can achieve the same level of metadata consistency
as provided by the underlying cluster file system.


\textbf{Layering on Panasas file system -- }
In PanFS \cite{PanFS}, \textit{Volume} is the basic logical unit
for administrators to manage the storage pool of PanFS.
The volume is a directory hierarchy with quota limit, and appears
as a directory below the single mount point of the whole storage system.
Each volume is only managed by a single metadata manager, but
the data of files created in the volume are spread over the entire storage pool.

A typical PanFS storage cluster may have multiple shelves,
each shelf consisting of one or two metadata managers and 9 or 10 storage nodes.
However, since a volume is assigned to a particular metadata manager,
all the metadata accesses to any files/directories in a volume
can only be served by that single metadata manager.

To take advantage of multiple metadata managers in PanFS,
our middleware load balance the storage of SSTables and large files across volumes.
Assume the case that we run the same number of \sys server processes
as the available metadata managers in PanFS.
\sys server processes can be run in the same machines that run PanFS metadata managers,
or in other machines behaving like proxies.
For each metadata manager, we create a volume and assign the volume
to a unique \sys server process.
The \sys server process then stores all the SSTables,
and large files in its managed directory partitions to it assigned volume.

\textbf{Fault tolerance -- }
The middleware design and techniques used for scaling the performance
of \sys does not impose any new major challenges on handling failures.
The primary functions required for fault tolerance include
replication of the \sys server's write-ahead logging for file system
state changes, detection of server failure, switching of backup servers,
and replaying of the replicated write-ahead log.
The replication of the write-ahead log may be not even necessary
if \sys is layered on a full-featured file system such as PanFS,
and the log can be replicated by the underlying file system.

For directory partition splitting and other operations requiring
distributed transactions (e.g.\texttt{ hardlink} and \texttt{rename}),
they can be implemented as a three-phase operation with protection
from write-ahead logging and garbaging collection of interrupted states.
\ldb also implements write-ahead logging and atomic batching operation
which can be used as primitives for fault tolerance in \tfs level.


The library version of client does not bring any new failure properties, either.
Directory-specific client state recovery is naturally supported by GIGA+
protocal, which only requires re-fetching the current server list and
rebuilding directory indexing by contacting speicfic servers.
For most operations except \texttt{open} and \texttt{close},
\sys server does not need to keep states for the clients.
Revoking the \texttt{open} handler for a large file can be achieved by
maintaining lease in the server side,
or by polling states from the underlying file system that
supports such functionality (e.g. PanFS).
The migration of small files from \tfs to the underlying file system is
handled by the \sys server, and is protected by the write-ahead logging.
